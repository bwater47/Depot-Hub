- An application that I refactored to use the latest technologies to manage and showcase books.

## Description

- <strong>Motivation:</strong> My motivation for building this application was to create a user-friendly and interactive e-commerce platform and to learn how to use Redux to manage global state effectively.
- <strong>Purpose:</strong> This project was built to demonstrate my skills in building a full-stack MERN application, providing a seamless and efficient user experience for managing an e-commerce store, with Redux handling the global state management.
- <strong>Problem Solved:</strong> This project solves the problem of managing state in a complex e-commerce application by using Redux instead of the Context API, offering a more scalable and maintainable solution.
- <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> In this project, I learned how to effectively use Redux for global state management in a React application. I transitioned the app from using the Context API to Redux, gaining a deeper understanding of reducers, actions, and the Redux store. Additionally, I reinforced my skills in CSS for styling, HTML for structuring web content, and Node.js with Express and Mongoose with GraphQL for backend functionality.
